        <p>This is Yanina. I began my working career as an English Teacher in Argentina. After teaching for two years I was promoted to the role of Team Leader, which I ended up loving. I've been a TL for 6 years now. In 2021 I decided that I needed to acquire more skills, that's when I began my Marketing programme and I graduated as a Community Manager with 10. Then, I pursued my SCRUM MASTER'S DEGREE which i successfully obtained. In 2022 I started studying to become a recruiter and I finally decided to embark upong the magnific journey of full stack developer. Wish me good luck! </p>
